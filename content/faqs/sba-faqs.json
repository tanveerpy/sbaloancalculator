                    "answer": "An SBA 7(a) loan is the most common and versatile loan program offered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. It provides financing up to $5 million for eligible small businesses to use for working capital, equipment purchases, real estate acquisition, refinancing debt, or business expansion. The SBA guarantees a portion of the loan (typically 75-85%), which reduces risk for lenders and makes it easier for small businesses to qualify compared to conventional loans.",

The business owner must have good personal credit (generally 680+ credit score) and the business should have been operating for at least 2 years, though startups may qualify under certain conditions.",

However, the SBA only guarantees a portion of this amount: 85% for loans up to $150,000 and 75% for loans above $150,000. For SBA Express loans (fast-track approval), the maximum is $500,000. The actual amount you can borrow depends on your business's cash flow, collateral, and ability to repay (DSCR).",

The timeline breaks down as: lender review (2-4 weeks), SBA review and approval (3-4 weeks), closing and funding (1-2 weeks). For faster approval, consider SBA Express loans which can be approved in as little as 36 hours, though they're limited to $500,000. You can speed up the process by having all required documents ready (3 years of tax returns, financial statements, business plan) before applying.",

For example: equipment purchases may require 10% down, commercial real estate often requires 15-20% down, and business acquisitions typically need 10-15% down. This down payment is called 'equity injection' and demonstrates your commitment to the business. Startups or businesses with weaker financials may be asked for higher down payments (20-30%).",

SBA 504 loans are specifically for purchasing fixed assets (real estate or equipment) with terms up to 25 years, typically offering lower interest rates but requiring a larger down payment (10% vs 10-20%). The key difference: 7(a) = versatile, 504 = real estate/equipment only. Many businesses use 504 for real estate purchases and 7(a) for working capital.",

                    "answer": "SBA 7(a) interest rates are calculated as the Prime Rate plus a margin (spread) that varies based on loan size and term. As of December 2025, the prime rate is 6.75%. The SBA sets maximum margins: for loans ≤ $25,000, the max margin is Prime + 4.75%; for loans $25,001-$50,000, Prime + 3.50%; for loans > $50,000, Prime + 2.75% (if term ≤ 7 years) or Prime + 2.75% (if term > 7 years). So an example rate for a $250,000 loan would be 6.75% (prime) + 2.50% (margin) = 9.25%. Rates can be fixed or variable.",

For FY 2026, the fee is tiered: 0% for loans ≤ $150,000, 3.5% on the guaranteed portion for loans $150,001-$700,000, and for loans > $700,000, it's 3.5% on the first $1 million guaranteed and 3.75% on amounts above $1 million. For example, a $500,000 loan (75% guaranteed = $375,000) would have a fee of $375,000 × 3.5% = $13,125. This fee can often be financed into the loan.",

(2) Apply the tiered rate: 3.5% on guaranteed portion ≤ $1M, 3.75% on guaranteed portion > $1M. Example: $800,000 loan → $600,000 guaranteed (75%) → Fee = $600,000 × 3.5% = $21,000.

Fixed-rate loans have the same interest rate for the entire loan term, providing predictable monthly payments (recommended for long-term loans or when rates are expected to rise). Variable-rate loans have interest rates that adjust quarterly based on changes in the prime rate, offering potentially lower initial rates but payment uncertainty (better for short-term loans or when rates are expected to fall).

Unlike the stated interest rate (which only reflects borrowing cost), APR accounts for the SBA guaranty fee, closing costs, and any other lender fees, expressed as a yearly rate. For example: a $250,000 loan at 7.5% interest with $10,000 in fees might have an APR of 7.82%. APR is calculated by amortizing all fees over the loan term and adding that cost to the interest rate.

For example, if your business has $150,000 in EBITDA, $40,000 in existing debt payments, and your new SBA loan would add $36,000/year in payments, your DSCR = $150,000 ÷ ($40,000 + $36,000) = 1.97. A DSCR above 1.0 means you generate more cash than needed to pay debts. Lenders want to see this 'cushion' to ensure you can handle the new loan.",

                    "answer": "Most SBA lenders require a minimum DSCR of 1.25, meaning your business must generate $1.25 in cash flow for every $1 of debt payment. Our calculator uses this scoring: Poor (< 1.0) = likely denial, Fair (1.0-1.24) = may qualify with strong collateral or guarantors, Good (1.25-1.49) = meets minimum requirements, Excellent (≥ 1.50) = strong approval odds. For example, if your annual debt payments total $100,000, you'd need at least $125,000 in EBITDA to meet the 1.25 minimum. Higher DSCR often means better loan terms and faster approval.",

                    "answer": "Yes, our calculator includes all major SBA 7(a) fees to give you the complete cost picture: (1) SBA guaranty fee using the official FY 2026 schedule (3.5-3.75% on guaranteed portion), (2) estimated closing costs at ~3% of loan amount (packaging, appraisal, legal, title, environmental), (3) effective APR that incorporates all fees and interest. We do not include the annual service fee (0.55% on loans > $150,000, capped at $3,000) as it's rare and waived by many lenders. The calculator provides a realistic total cost estimate that's more accurate than basic payment-only calculators.",

Personal documents: 3 years of personal tax returns for all owners with 20%+ ownership, personal financial statement, resume showing relevant experience. Financial documents: 6 months of bank statements, aging reports (accounts receivable/payable), debt schedule listing all current loans. Real estate loans also require: appraisal, environmental report, title work. Having these ready before applying can reduce approval time by 2-3 weeks.",

                    "answer": "SBA Express is a fast-track version of the 7(a) loan program offering quicker approval (as little as 36 hours vs 60-90 days for standard loans) in exchange for lower loan amounts (max $500,000 vs $5M) and a lower SBA guarantee (50% vs 75-85%). Express loans use a streamlined application process and give lenders more decision-making authority. They're ideal for: smaller loan amounts, businesses needing quick funding, working capital or equipment purchases, and borrowers with strong credit and financials. Interest rates are typically slightly higher (Prime + 4.5-6.5%) compared to standard 7(a) loans.",

                    "answer": "Yes, you can prepay SBA 7(a) loans without penalty if the loan term is less than 15 years. For loans with terms of 15 years or more, prepayment penalties may apply during the first 3 years: Year 1 = 5% of prepayment amount, Year 2 = 3% of prepayment amount, Year 3 = 1% of prepayment amount, Year 4+ = 0% (no penalty). For example, if you prepay $100,000 in Year 1 of a 20-year loan, the penalty would be $5,000. Most working capital and equipment loans have terms under 10 years and can be prepaid anytime without penalty.",
