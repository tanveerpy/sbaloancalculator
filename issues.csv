"Issue Name","Issue Type","Issue Priority","URLs","% of Total","Description","How To Fix"
"Canonicals: Canonicalised","Warning","High","2","28.570","Pages that have a canonical to a different URL. The URL is 'canonicalised' to another location. This means the search engines are being instructed to not index the page, and the indexing and linking properties should be consolidated to the URL in the canonical.","These URLs should be reviewed carefully to ensure the indexing and link signals are being consolidated to the correct URL. In a perfect world, a website wouldn't need to canonicalise any URLs as only canonical versions would be linked to internally on a website, but often they are required due to various circumstances outside of control, and to prevent duplicate content. Update internal links to canonical versions of URLs where possible."
"Security: Missing Content-Security-Policy Header","Warning","Low","20","80.000","URLs that are missing the Content-Security-Policy response header. This header allows a website to control which resources are loaded for a page. This policy can help guard against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks that exploit the browser's trust of the content received from the server. The SEO Spider only checks for existence of the header, and does not interrogate the policies found within the header to determine whether they are well set-up for the website. This should be performed manually.","Set a strict Content-Security-Policy response header across all page to help mitigate cross site scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks."
"Security: Missing Secure Referrer-Policy Header","Warning","Low","20","80.000","URLs missing 'no-referrer-when-downgrade', 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin', 'no-referrer' or 'strict-origin' policies in the Referrer-Policy header. When using HTTPS, it's important that the URLs do not leak in non-HTTPS requests. This can expose users to 'man in the middle' attacks, as anyone on the network can view them.","Consider setting a referrer policy of strict-origin-when-cross-origin. It retains much of the referrer's usefulness, while mitigating the risk of leaking data cross-origins."
"Content: Low Content Pages","Opportunity","Medium","2","28.570","Pages with a word count that is below the default 200 words. The word count is based upon the content area settings used in the analysis which can be configured via 'Config > Content > Area'. There isn't a minimum word count for pages in reality, but the search engines do require descriptive text to understand the purpose of a page. This filter should only be used as a rough guide to help identify pages that might be improved by adding more descriptive content in the context of the website and page's purpose. Some websites, such as ecommerce, will naturally have lower word counts, which can be acceptable if a products details can be communicated efficiently.","Consider including additional descriptive content to help the user and search engines better understand the page."
"Security: Missing X-Content-Type-Options Header","Warning","Low","20","80.000","URLs that are missing the 'X-Content-Type-Options' response header with a 'nosniff' value. In the absence of a MIME type, browsers may 'sniff' to guess the content type to interpret it correctly for users. However, this can be exploited by attackers who can try and load malicious code, such as JavaScript via an image they have compromised.","To minimise security issues, the X-Content-Type-Options response header should be supplied and set to 'nosniff'. This instructs browsers to rely only on the Content-Type header and block anything that does not match accurately. This also means the content-type set needs to be accurate."
"Security: Missing X-Frame-Options Header","Warning","Low","20","80.000","URLs missing an X-Frame-Options response header with a 'DENY' or 'SAMEORIGIN' value. This instructs the browser not to render a page within a frame, iframe, embed or object. This helps avoid 'clickjacking' attacks, where your content is displayed on another web page that is controlled by an attacker.","To minimise security issues, the X-Frame-Options response header should be supplied with a 'DENY' or 'SAMEORIGIN' value."
"Directives: Nofollow","Warning","High","3","15.000","URLs containing a 'nofollow' directive in either a robots meta tag or X-Robots-Tag in the HTTP header. This is a 'hint' which tells the search engines not to follow any links on the page for crawling. This is generally used by mistake in combination with 'noindex', when there is no need to include this directive as it stops 'PageRank' from being passed onwards. To crawl pages with a nofollow directive within the SEO Spider, enable 'Follow Internal Nofollow' via 'Config > Spider'.","URLs with a 'nofollow' should be reviewed carefully to ensure that links shouldn't be crawled and PageRank shouldn't be passed on. If outlinks should be crawled and PageRank should be passed onwards, then the 'nofollow' directive should be removed."
"H2: Missing","Warning","Low","1","14.290","Pages which have a missing <h2>, the content is empty or has a whitespace. The <h2> heading is often used to describe sections or topics within a document. They act as signposts for the user, and can help search engines understand the page.","Consider using logical and descriptive <h2>s on important pages that help the user and search engines better understand the page."
"Directives: Noindex","Warning","High","3","15.000","URLs containing a 'noindex' directive in either a robots meta tag or X-Robots-Tag in the HTTP header. This instructs the search engines not to index the page. The page will still be crawled (to see the directive), but it will then be dropped from the index.","URLs with a 'noindex' should be reviewed carefully to ensure they are correct and shouldn't be indexed. If these pages should be indexed, then the 'noindex' directive should be removed."
"Response Codes: Internal Client Error (4xx)","Issue","High","5","18.520","Internal URLs with a client-side error. This indicates a problem occurred with the URL request and can include responses such as 400 bad request, 403 Forbidden, 404 Page Not Found, 410 Removed, 429 Too Many Requests and more. A 404 'Page Not Found' is the most common, and often referred to as a broken link. View URLs that link to errors using the lower 'inlinks' tab and export them in bulk via 'Bulk Export > Response Codes > Internal > Client Error (4xx) inlinks'.","All links on a website should ideally resolve to 200 'OK' URLs. Errors such as a 404 or 410 should be updated to their correct locations, removed and redirected where appropriate. A 403 forbidden error occurs when a web server denies access to the SEO Spider's request and can often be resolved by switching the user-agent to Chrome via 'Config > User-Agent' and crawling again."
